DISPATCH RECORDING SYSTEM – ONE PAGE OVERVIEW
Current Pain Points
* Delivery tracking is paper-based; invoices get lost or damaged.
* No reliable proof of delivery (GPS + timestamp) leading to disputes.
* Petrol/petty-cash claims lack GPS/time evidence, increasing fraud risk.
* Admin spends hours reconciling delivery sheets and approvals.
* No real-time visibility of what each driver delivered.
Proposed Solution: Web Application + Mobile PWA
* Lightweight system accessible on any phone (Android/iPhone).
* Drivers install it via 'Add to Home Screen' — no Play Store required.
Driver App (PWA)
* Daily assigned invoices visible in-app.
* One-tap ‘Delivered’ captures GPS + timestamp automatically.
* Optional customer signature/photo proof.
* Petrol claims via in-app photo/video with automatic geotag & time-stamp.
* Offline-first design — syncs automatically when network returns.
Admin Web Dashboard
* Live delivery map with timestamps and driver status.
* Petty-cash approval module with attached evidence.
* Excel export for accounting.
* Complete audit trail of all driver actions.
Key Benefits
* Zero paperwork, fully digital workflow.
* Fraud-resistant petty-cash submissions.
* Faster reconciliation — hours reduced to minutes.
* Reliable & verifiable proof of delivery.
* Simple UI suitable for non-technical drivers.
Why PWA?
* Works on any smartphone without app-store installation.
* Offline mode ensures uninterrupted usage.
* Cheaper and faster to maintain compared to native apps.


Implementation Timeline
* Week 1–2: UI + Backend setup
* Week 3–4: Driver PWA (deliveries + GPS + petty cash)
* Week 5–6: Admin Dashboard + reports
* Week 7–8: Pilot with real drivers + refinements

RESULT: A practical, field-ready dispatch recording system that provides full transparency, reduces fraud, and simplifies the entire delivery workflow.
